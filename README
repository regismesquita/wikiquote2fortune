Straight to the point:

1. Find a page you like in wikiquote, in my case BSG page : http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%282003%29
2. Choose a name for you fortune file , in my case: bsg_fortune
3. Run the program: ./wikiquote2fortune  http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%282003%29 bsg_fortune
4. All ready just run fortune bsg_fortune , and everything should be ok.

Note: I developed this code while some tests for my app were running, so there might be bugs...
Note 2: I don't work with shellscript daily so probably there's a better way of doing that, contribute if you know how...
